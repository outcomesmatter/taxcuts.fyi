      Every tax cut for billionaires is a tax increase on you and me. <i>Period.</i>

      Every dollar that billionaires don't pay in taxes either comes from you and me, or results in cuts to services that you and I rely on.

        Some of these reduced services are pretty obvious: cuts to Medicaid, or reduced hours at National Parks. But many others are a bit more subtle and affect your life in countless tiny ways. But it all adds up.

      <ul>
        <li>Cuts to Social Security staffing, which means very long lines when you need to fix that problem with your elderly mom's payments.</li>
        <li>A longer daily commute, as the federal funding for that highway expansion evaporated, robbing you of time with your family every single workday.</li>
        <li>Less effective meat inspections, so you end up getting food poisoning more often and have to burn a PTO day you could have used for a family getaway instead.</li>
        <li>Strangled medical research, which means that the cure your sister needs doesn't arrive in time.</li>
      </ul>
