      Every tax cut for billionaires is a tax increase on you and me. <i>Period.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="subheading">
      Every dollar that billionaires don't pay in taxes either comes from you and me, or results in cuts to services that you and I rely on.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Some of these reduced services are pretty obvious: cuts to Medicaid coverage, reduction in food stamps, or reduced hours at National Parks.
      </p>
      <p>But many others are more subtle, and instead affect your life in <em>countless</em> tiny ways. But, boy, it all adds up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cuts to Social Security staffing, which means very long lines when you need to fix that problem with your elderly mom's payments.</li>
        <li>A longer daily commute, as the federal funding for that highway expansion evaporated, robbing you of time with your family every single workday.</li>
        <li>Less effective meat inspections, so you end up getting food poisoning more often and have to burn a PTO day you could have used for a family getaway instead.</li>
        <li>Strangled medical research, which means that the cure your sister needs doesn't arrive in time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>It all adds up.</b> It adds up to make your life worse. It robs you things you deserve: your free time, the benefits you've earned, the health you deserve, the financial opportunity you need. It's easy to get distracted by cultural or side issues.</p>
<p>But <em>every</em> tax cut for billionaries is a tax increase for you and me. We get fewer services than our taxes used to buy.</p>
